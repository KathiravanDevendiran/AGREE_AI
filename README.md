crop health using satellite AI
Crop Health Monitoring Using Satellite AI, is a smart agricultural solution that uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to analyze the condition of crops remotely. It processes data like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from satellite scans to detect early signs of crop stress—such as pest attacks, water deficiency, or nutrient imbalances—often before they're visible to the human eye.
This helps farmers make faster, more informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting, ultimately improving yield and resource efficiency
